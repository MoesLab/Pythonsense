# Pythonsense
## A Python IoT toolbox for Linux OS using appJar 

I always wanted to have a small computer to test and troubleshoot different tasks and problems I face every day at work sites.  
I am a Control System Programmer and Audio / Video integrator who usually deal with network issues and problem related to wire/wireless communication with clients site most of these problems can be discovered and troubleshoot by a laptop computer,
but in my case I want something smaller specially designed for my applications, so here I will design my own tool and share
documented pathway and programs that make up this project. 

### Functions:
1: HDMI and 3.5 Audio provider for testing A/V equipment  
2: Monitor IP, Subnet mask and default gateway on the display to test network gears  
3: Monitor and test peripheral devices for Bluetooth and Serial    
4: Monitor and control of IoT devices locally or from cloud  
//RGB light, Proxy sensors, Motion sensors, Temp/Humidity sensors, GPS and Relay sensors and so on  

### Hardware:
A Raspberry pi with linux kerenel (mine is a version of Debian)  
A 3.5 LCD touch screen resistive as a hat for the pi   
A USB power pack (mine is home made)  

### Software:
Debian kernel for teh pi  
Python 3.7  with AppJar 0.98 package installed  
the actual program "pythonsense" and all .gif pictures are  included in this repository  

### other HW:
Keyboard and Gamepad to interface with pi and they are Bluetooth enabled.  
There are multiple ESP8266/ESP32 development boards to gather information for this project with all info associated with them  
have their own repositories.
