I always wanted to have a small computer to test and troubleshoot different tasks and problems I face everyday at work sites.
I am a control system programmer and Audio / video integartor who usually deal with network issues and problem related to wire/wireless communication at clients site most of this problems can be discover and troubleshoot by a laptop computer, but in my case I want something smaller specially designed for my applications, so here is a pathway documantion and programs that make up this project.

A Raspberry pi with linux kerenel (mine is a version of Debian)
A 3.5 LCD touch screen resistive as a hat for the pi 
A USB power pack (mine is home made)

Python 3.7  with AppJar 0.98 package installed
the actual program "pythonesense" and all .gif pictures are  included in this repository

There are multiple ESP8266/ESP32 development boards to gather information for this project with all info associated with them have their own repositories.
